## Rspamd Installation for use with Smartermail

:information_source: This is a guide to install and configure Rspamd for use with SmarterMail.

Since build 8510 (April 20, 2023) [SmarterMail](https://www.smartertools.com/smartermail/business-email-server) supports the long-awaited spam filtering system called  [Rspamd](https://rspamd.com/). Rspamd runs on a separate linux server.

The installation isn't really hard, but the configuration could be tricky and needs time to understand concept :bulb: 

Let's head over the [Wiki](../../wiki) I think one hour time is enough to accomplish this work.
