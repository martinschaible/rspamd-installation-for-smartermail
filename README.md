## Rspamd Installation for use with Smartermail

:fire: This is a guide to install and configure Rspamd for use with SmarterMail.

Since build 8510 (April 20, 2023) [SmarterMail](https://www.smartertools.com/smartermail/business-email-server) supports the long-awaited spam filtering system called  [Rspamd](https://rspamd.com/).

Rspamd runs on a separate linux server. The installation isn't really hard, but the configuration could be tricky and needs time to understand :bulb:

You found an error, a typo or my english is to bad? Then please open an issue.

### What's next?

Rspamd needs tweaking to combat against spam. New specific modules have to be developed to combat global and country-specific spam and malware.
For this, i will create a new repository soon.
